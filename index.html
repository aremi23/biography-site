						<h2>Increased Stature</h2>
						<p>
							As a composer, Chopin acquired increased stature after a period in
							the late 19th century when his work often was judged by academic
							standards that were insensible to its individual character.
						</p>

						<h2>Vast Range</h2>
						<p>
							Chopin's small output was mostly confined to solo piano; yet
							within its limited framework its range is seen to be vast,
							comprehending every variety of musical expression.

						<h2>True Worth</h2>
						<p>
							Though Chopin squandered too much time on the drawing-room
							Parisian aristocracy and disappointed critics who valued artistic
							worth only in terms of large-scale achievement, he was immediately
							recognized at his true worth by more-discerning contemporaries,
							who were astounded by the startling originality he reconciled with
							exquisite craftsmanship.

					<div class="info4">
						<h2>New Sonorities</h2>
						<p>
							Present-day evaluation places him among the immortals of music by
							reason of his insight into the secret places of the heart and
							because of his awareness of the magical new sonorities to be drawn
							from the piano.
