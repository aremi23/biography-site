						<h2>Increased Stature</h2>
						<p>
							As a composer, Chopin acquired increased stature after a period in
							the late 19th century when his work often was judged by academic
							standards that were insensible to its individual character.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="section2">
					<div class="info2">
						<h2>Vast Range</h2>
						<p>
							Chopin's small output was mostly confined to solo piano; yet
							within its limited framework its range is seen to be vast,
							comprehending every variety of musical expression.

						<h2>True Worth</h2>
						<p>
							Though Chopin squandered too much time on the drawing-room
							Parisian aristocracy and disappointed critics who valued artistic
							worth only in terms of large-scale achievement, he was immediately
							recognized at his true worth by more-discerning contemporaries,
							who were astounded by the startling originality he reconciled with
							exquisite craftsmanship.

				<div class="section4">
					<div class="info4">
						<h2>New Sonorities</h2>
						<p>
							Present-day evaluation places him among the immortals of music by
							reason of his insight into the secret places of the heart and
							because of his awareness of the magical new sonorities to be drawn
							from the piano.

						Even today, Poland claims Frederic Chopin as a national icon. If you
						wanted, you could take a whole Chopin-themed trip! Arrive at the
						Warsaw Chopin Airport and take a bus out to his childhood home in
						Żelazowa Wola. Then, visit the Chopin Institute in Warsaw, a
						research center, performance venue, and museum dedicated to the
						composer’s life and work. If you happen to be there at the right
						time, you might even catch the International Chopin Piano
						Competition – the Olympics of piano competitions, held every five
						years. Winners have included Maurizio Pollini, Martha Argerich, and
						Krystian Zimerman, all of whom are featured as performers on our
						Chopin Essentials playlist on Spotify.
